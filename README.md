# Image Classifier using Tensorflow

In this project we build a simple neural network architecture to distinguish a Chihuahua (a dog breed) from a Muffin.

Folders are organized as follow (all with different images):
- train_set: 5 Chihuahua and 5 muffin images.
- validation_set: 8 Chihuahua and 8 muffin images
- test_set: 7 Chihuahua and 7 muffin images
